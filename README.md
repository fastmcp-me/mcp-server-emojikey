MCP server for persisting LLM relationship context as emoji-based memory keys. This allows Claude to maintain consistent interaction styles and remember relationship context across conversations.

Emojikeys are stored online, so you can use them across devices and applications. No user information is stored other than the emojikeys.

> üìù **Note**
> Usage note: The first time you use the tool in Claude desktop, tell Claude to "Set emojikey" then next time you start a conversation, he will automatically use this key. You can ask to set vibe, or show emojikey history as well. Have fun!

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**
> This is a beta version, more features are planned, so the API may change.

## Usage with Claude Desktop

Get your API key from [emojikey.io](https://emojikey.io) and add this to your config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "emojikey": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@identimoji/mcp-server-emojikey"],
      "env": {
        "EMOJIKEYIO_API_KEY": "your-api-key-from-emojikey.io",
        "MODEL_ID": "Claude-3-5-Sonnet-20241022"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Config locations:
- MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

First-time usage: Tell Claude to "Set emojikey". On subsequent conversations, Claude will automatically use this key to maintain context.

## Tools

- `initialize_conversation` - Get current emojikey at start of conversation
- `get_emojikey` - Retrieve current emojikey when requested
- `set_emojikey` - Create and store a new emojikey
- `create_superkey` - Create a compressed superkey (after 10 regular emojikeys)
- `get_emojikey_history` - View previous emojikeys

## Superkeys

After creating 10 regular emojikeys, Claude will be prompted to create a superkey that compresses their meaning into a single key with format: `[[√ó10emoji-sequence]]`

This allows Claude to maintain a longer conversation history context.
